# README: Random Number Generator for Windows
Note that this program may not work as expected. In order to run this program on macOS, use Wine, us a Windows VM or use Bootcamp (Intel only) to run Windows natively. The .py code file is attatched to each release (excluding Version 0.0.1 as the .py file was lost) for you to look at if you wish. However, versions 0.0.6, 0.0.7 and 0.0.71 do not include .py files as these updates only included installers, not any new features. The .py file is the same as in version 0.0.5.
# Known issues with this program
Due to the fact you are downloading a .exe file directly, there are some issues that arise when opening the file. Please read the section relating to how you are opening the file.
# Google Chrome or Chromium-based browser (Excluding Microsoft Edge):
After downloading, the file may take a while to open while a virus scan takes place. Do NOT click the open button multiple times as the program will glitch and open many windows constantly until the program is restarted. However, after re-opening the file the second time, the file should take a few seconds to open.
# Microsoft Edge:
In order to open the .exe, you must tell Edge that the file is sadfe to open and that you want to keep it. You can do this using the following method:
1) Hover over the file and click the ellipsis (...) button.
2) Select 'Keep'.
3) Select the down arrow to the right of the 'Delete' button and click 'Keep anyway'.
4) Open the file.
# From the Windows downloads folder:
If you have downloaded it from Google Chrome or another Chromium-based browser (excluding Microsoft Edge) and you are opening the file for the first time, but you are doing it from the Windows downloads folder, the file wil take a while to open whilst a virus scan takes place. Do NOT click the open button multiple times as the program will glitch and open many windows constantly until the program is restarted. However, after re-opening the file the second time, the file should take a few seconds to open. If you have downloaded it from Microsft Edge, and you have followed the steps in the 'Microsoft Edge' section, the file is already scanned and should open as it would as if opening it for the second time.
# Version 0.0.6 or later
As an installer is now included with these versions, you do NOT need to follow the instructions above. When you open the installer file, a user account control [rompt will appear. Click 'yes', and after installation, the app can be opened from the start menu.
